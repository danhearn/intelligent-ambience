# Intelligent Ambience (working title)

Intelligent Ambience began as a system that listens to a room and generates ambient music in response. It grew into something broader â€” a web-based, decentralised platform where people upload images and receive soundscapes shaped by location, time, and cultural context. Each output is mediated through AI, exposing both the limits and possibilities of machine learning. 
By collecting feedback, the system experiments with whether ambience can be refined collectively, across contexts and cultures. Beyond the sound itself, the project invites reflection on how agentic systems work, how we train them, and how they mediate our sense of place.

To do: 
- Finalise back-end agent system.
- Basic UI including exposed agentic reasoning.
- Deploy.

Future Development: 
- Include database and user feed/map of all previous inputs/outputs.
- Vector Database Visualisation and Exploration.
